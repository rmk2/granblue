Granblue
========

## About

This project contains a collection of scripts and libraries that help players
of the online game Granblue Fantasy. As a personal collection, it does not
follow a particularly focused approach, but tries to solve problems as they
appear while playing. Among such issues are account management and weapon grid
calculations.

## Quick setup

This is a Racket project. Install Racket and follow these steps to run it:

```
# Link the Granblue Racket library correctly
raco link --name granblue --user lib
```
